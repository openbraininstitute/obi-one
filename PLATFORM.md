# 4. Platform

Any **project** created through the platform has a direct correspondence with the proposed **GitHub** project structure, and vice versa. 

Under this organization, the Platform can offer:

- **An entry point for new users to generate projects, parameterize configuration files, build pipelines.** 

    The GUI offers both:
    - 1. Simple form based parameterization of configuration files based on the schema of any OBI-SDK library function.
    - 2. More advanced custom GUI elements for parameterizing configuration files (i.e. existing single cell).

- **Clear, general and hierarchical organization and navigation of complex multifaceted models.** 

    The hierachical organization of the modeling library and user projects corresponds with easy navigation through the platform to:
    - GUI elements
    - Code 
    - Description of:
        - Building steps
        - Rationale
        - Validations and discrepencies
        - Predictions

    
    This has huge benefits for the communication of models; both for potential users and peer reviewers. 
    
    Currently both groups have to dive into many recent and historic publications and code bases to understand these aspects.
