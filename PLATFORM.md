# 4. Platform

Any **project** created through the platform has a direct correspondence with the proposed **GitHub** project structure, and vice versa. 

Under this organization, the Platform can offer:

- **An entry point for new users to generate projects and parameterize configuration files.** Through the GUI they can create projects and gradually build up pipelines of functions. The GUI offers both 1) simple form based parameterization of configuration files based on the schema of any OBI-SDK library function and 2) more advanced custom GUI elements for parameterizing configuration files (i.e. existing single cell).

- **Clear, general and hierarchical organization and navigation of complex multifaceted models. The hierachical organization of the underlying GitHub repository corresponds with easy navigation through the platform to code, rationale, description of methods and results for all validations, predictions and building steps.** This has huge benefits for the communication of models; both for potential users and peer reviewers. Currently both groups have to dive into many recent and historic publications, to understand the building steps, rational, validations and predictions made with our models.
