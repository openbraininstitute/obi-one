# OBI-SDK + Platform Integration - Scientific Proposal
- Here we define an initial **proposal** for a general organization of code and data, which can:
    - **Maximise the scientific utility of the Platform**
    - **Accelerate the field of Simulations Neuroscience**
- The aim is to provide a basis for discussions, iteration and the potential prototyping of a general data and code organization.
- The general idea is to have a single SDK for using BBP libraries with AWS, SQL persistance and version control of user code. The SDK can be used both directly by users and by the platform.
