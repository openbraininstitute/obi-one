Ideal renaming which would require migration:
- GridScan -> GridScanGenerationTask
- CoupledScan -> CoupledScanGenerationTask
- GridScan.form -> single_config
- SimulationsForm, Simulation -> XScanConfig XSingleConfig

Todo:
- Better names to non simulation configs + tasks
- Generated endpoints must return campaign id
- Update all project notebooks
- Move ninja files from tasks
- Rename Contribute configs + tasks (speak with Dan)
