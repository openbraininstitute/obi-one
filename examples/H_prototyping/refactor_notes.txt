Ideal renaming which would require migration:
- GridScan -> GridScanGeneration
- CoupledScan -> CoupledScanGeneration
- GridScan.form -> single_config
- Names of specific Forms

Get rid of Form + SingleCoordinateMixin references as much as possible (use renamed)

GIVE BETTER NAMES TO NON SIMULATION CONFIGS + TASKS

- Problem with circuit_simulations_example.ipynb
- "make test-local" generating logs


generated endpoints must return campaign id


- Move ninja files from tasks
