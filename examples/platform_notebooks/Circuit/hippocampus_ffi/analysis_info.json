    "description": "This analysis run on two simulations set to evaluate the effect of feedforward inhibition. The notebook produce a plot of input-output curve with and without inhibition. This simulation is far from the activity seen in the complete CA1 model, but it represents a useful simplify model which allows to test simple hypotheses.",
