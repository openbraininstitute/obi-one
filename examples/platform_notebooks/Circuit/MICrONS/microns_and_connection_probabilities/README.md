## Summary

We calculate connection probabilities (within 100 um inter-soma distance), first for L5PCs, then for all pathways. For accuracy, we focus on neurons that have passed manual proofreading.

Next, we explore an alternative way of calculating connection probabilities: Instead of considering all pairs of neurons and filtering them to pairs within 100 um, we instead emulate a slicing and sampling procedure, such as is performed in the wetlab.
## Use
Simply follow the instructions set out in the notebook.
