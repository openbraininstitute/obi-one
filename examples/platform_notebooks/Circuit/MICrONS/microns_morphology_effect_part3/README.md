## Summary
We will further analyze how morphologes give rise to the non-random structure of connectivity.

** This is a continuation of the analyses in "MICrONS morphology connectivity effect" and "MICrONS morphology connectivity effect - part 2". We strongly suggest you study those notebooks first **

In this notebook we extend the analysis to capture non-random statistical interactions between connections into different spatial bins. 

The main purpose is to further distinguish the "local" and "global" effects explained in part 2. And to demonstrate that the proposed effect has a complex spatial structure that is difficult to capture without neuron morphologies.

## Use
Simply follow the instructions set out in the notebook.
But we strongly urge you to read the instructions for each cell before running it. There are important instructions contained.
