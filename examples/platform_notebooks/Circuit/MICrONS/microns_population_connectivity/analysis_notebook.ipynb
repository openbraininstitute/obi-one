    "# Analysis of the spatial structure of connectivity in the MICrONS dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The MICrONS initiative provided a dense reconstruction of around a cubic milimeter of mouse brain tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "At OBI, we have converted that data into the SONATA format that is often used to represent biophysically-detailed computational models of neuronal circuitry. We believe that this is a useful resource for the community for the following reasons:\n",
    " 1. It allows direct comparison of models to the data, as both are in the same format. In the future it may even be possible to simulate the MICrONS circuitry as one simulates the computational models.\n",
    " 2. There are many useful code libraries for analyzing SONATA-formatted circuits.\n",
    " 3. It is reduced representation of the data. While this discards a lot of information, what remains is still very useful for many purposes. And the reduced data can be more easily handled and analyzed faster.\n",
    " 4. During the conversion to SONATA we added derived data. Specifically, high-quality morphology skeletons with extracted spines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we want to expand on point (3) above. We demonstrate an examplary use case, where we analyze the data at the level of the wiring diagram, i.e., as a graph representation with neurons as vertices and the presence of a synaptic connection indicated by directed edges."

    "### Summary of the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform a proof-of-concept analysis that reveals how structured and non-random the connectivity is. Specifically, we will look at the spatial structure of connectivity, i.e., how it depends on the relative locations of pre- and post-synaptic somata. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will count how many connected pairs of neurons exist at given horizontal and vertical offsets and then look for _asymetries_. In distance-dependent, but unstructured connectivity, we would expect the same number of connections for, e.g., delta-x=100 um as for delta-x=-100 um. The exception would be the depth axis, as we know that connectivity is structured along cortical layers. But as we will see, the MICrONS data has structure even beyond that!\n",
    "\n",
    "To our knowledge, this type of analysis has not been performed before, simply because no comparable dataset of biological connectivity was available. We argue that the MICrONS data has been a paradigm shift in terms of the quantity and density of available connectivity information, and the analyses we perform should reflect that and become more ambitious and diverse."
