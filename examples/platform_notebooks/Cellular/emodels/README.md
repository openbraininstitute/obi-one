This folder contains notebooks to perform several experiments on the electrical models (e-models) from the Open Brain Platform (OBP).

## Downloading Data for notebooks
E-model resources required to run these notebooks
- e-model `hoc` file
- morphology file (`.swc` or `.asc`) and
- mechanisms (`.mod` files)
- EModel resource `json` (`EM_*.json`) with final parameters of the e-model (only for [parameter_plots notebook](parameters_plot/analysis_notebook.ipynb)).


These could be downloaded from
- [Blue Brain Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/bluebrain_opendata/) using [Amazon CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
-  EModel resource `json` for each e-model can be downloaded from the e-model page of platform. We will soon enable users to download all above mentioned e-model resources from the OBP.


### Downloading the model hoc file, morphology and mechanism:


1. Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) based on [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for your operating system.

1. Run the following commands
    ```
    # check if the directory exists if not create it
    !if [ ! -d "cadpyr_emodel" ]; then mkdir cadpyr_emodel; fi

    # download mechanisms (mod files)
    !aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://openbluebrain/Model_Data/Electrophysiological_models/SSCx/OBP_SSCx/emodels/detailed/cADpyr/mechanisms ./cadpyr_emodel/mechanisms

    # hoc file
    !aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://openbluebrain/Model_Data/Electrophysiological_models/SSCx/OBP_SSCx/emodels/detailed/cADpyr/model.hoc ./cadpyr_emodel/model.hoc

    # morphology file
    !aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://openbluebrain/Model_Data/Electrophysiological_models/SSCx/OBP_SSCx/emodels/detailed/cADpyr/C060114A5.asc ./cadpyr_emodel/C060114A5.asc
    ```
    The downloaded folder with data is `./cadpyr_emodel`.

    You can also download the morphology from the platform:
    Go to the https://www.openbraininstitute.org/ --> go to your virtual lab --> Explore --> Morphology (bottom of the page) --> in the searchbar, search for `C060114A5.asc` --> click on the morphology with species `Rattus norvegicus` --> Download (top of the page).
    This will download a zip file with morphology asc file. Extract the zip file and put the `C060114A5.asc` file in the `cadpyr_emodel` folder.

### Downlaoding EModel resource `json
The EModel json can be obtained either by:
- Go to the https://www.openbraininstitute.org/ --> go to your virtual lab --> Explore --> Model Data (on the top)  --> E-model (bottom of the page) --> in the searchbar, search for `EM__1372346__cADpyr__13` --> click on the model to go to the model page --> Download.
This will download a zip file with json resource.
- Use AWS CLI. Run this command in terminal:
    ```
    aws s3 cp --no-sign-request s3://openbluebrain/Model_Data/Electrophysiological_models/SSCx/OBP_SSCx/emodels/detailed/cADpyr/EM__emodel=cADpyr__etype=cADpyr__mtype=L5_TPC_A__species=mouse__brain_region=grey__iteration=1372346__13.json .
    ```

Here is brief introduction of each experiment

- [**`Optimised Parameter Comaprison Plot`**](parameters_plot/analysis_notebook.ipynb):
    - Compare parameters of an e-model across sections on Open Brain Institute Platform (OBP)
    - This notebook uses the final e-model paramters stored in EM__*.json file and compare the optimised paramters for different sections of the neuron e-model
    - We show a `scatter plot` and `heatmap` of parameters accross sections
    - The pipeline store the final e-model details in a json file  containing details such as
        - `fitness`  : the e-model score (sum of e-feature z-scores)
        - `parameter`: the hall of fame (best) parameters values which are were selected for different sections of the detailed morphology.
        - `score`    : individual e-feature z-scores
        - `features` : individual e-feature absolute values
        - `scoreValidation` : validation score
        - `passedValidation`(bool) : passed or failed validation
        - `seed` : selected seed value from the multiple optimisation runs
