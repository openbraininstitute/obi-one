## Summary
We distinguish proximal vs. distal innervation on a dendrite by the path distance of a synapse to the post-synaptic soma. This uses an arbitray cutoff, such as 100 um. In order to study the effects of proximal vs distal innervation, it is useful to know how much dendritic length lies between such cutoffs. This allows for more systematic control of variables (such as afferent synapse densities) later on. This notebook provides that functionality.

## Use
Simply run the cells of the notebook.
