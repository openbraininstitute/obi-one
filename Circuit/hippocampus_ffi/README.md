## Summary
This notebook analyzes two simulations set up to test the effect of feedforward inhibition on the transmission from CA3 to CA1 through Schaffer collaterals. The notebook produces a final plot which shows input-output curves of a CA1 pyramidal cell with and without feedforward inhibition.

## Use
The cells can be run until the end of the notebook.
