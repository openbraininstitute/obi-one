## Summary
We will further analyze how morphologes give rise to the non-random structure of connectivity.

** This is a continuation of the analyses in "MICrONS morphology connectivity effect". We strongly suggest you study that notebook first **

In this notebook we extend the analysis to two dimensions to capture the spatial structure of the effect of morphology on non-random connectivity. Additionally, we also compare to a configuration model control

The main purpose is to distinguish two parts of the proposed effect: A "global" one that can be captured by a configuration model, i.e. by long-tailed degree distributions. And a "local" one that is novel.

## Use
Simply follow the instructions set out in the notebook.
But we strongly urge you to read the instructions for each cell before running it. There are important instructions contained.
