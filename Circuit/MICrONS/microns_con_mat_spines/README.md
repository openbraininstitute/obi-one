## Summary

This is less of an analysis and more of a demonstration of how to access spine- and synapse-related data of the MICrONS data, represented in the SONATA format. It serves to teach you the basics of structural analyses of SONATA circuits.

However, as examples, we calculate the fractions and number of shaft vs. spine synapses of 100 neurons, and the propertions of pre-synaptic neuron types.
## Use
Simply follow the instructions set out in the notebook.
