    "# Accessing synapse and spine info of the MICrONS data\n",
    "\n",
    "The MICrONS initiative provided a dense reconstruction of around a cubic milimeter of mouse brain tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "At OBI, we have converted that data into the SONATA format that is often used to represent biophysically-detailed computational models of neuronal circuitry. We believe that this is a useful resource for the community for the following reasons:\n",
    " 1. It allows direct comparison of models to the data, as both are in the same format. In the future it may even be possible to simulate the MICrONS circuitry as one simulates the computational models.\n",
    " 2. There are many useful code libraries for analyzing SONATA-formatted circuits.\n",
    " 3. It is reduced representation of the data. While this discards a lot of information, what remains is still very useful for many purposes. And the reduced data can be more easily handled and analyzed faster.\n",
    " 4. During the conversion to SONATA we added derived data. Specifically, high-quality morphology skeletons with extracted spines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
