## Summary
We will perform a proof-of-concept analysis that reveals how structured and non-random the connectivity is. Specifically, we will look at the spatial structure of connectivity, i.e., how it depends on the relative locations of pre- and post-synaptic somata. 

We will count how many connected pairs of neurons exist at given horizontal and vertical offsets and then look for _asymetries_. In distance-dependent, but unstructured connectivity, we would expect the same number of connections for, e.g., delta-x=100 um as for delta-x=-100 um. The exception would be the depth axis, as we know that connectivity is structured along cortical layers. But as we will see, the MICrONS data has structure even beyond that!

To our knowledge, this type of analysis has not been performed before, simply because no comparable dataset of biological connectivity was available. We argue that the MICrONS data has been a paradigm shift in terms of the quantity and density of available connectivity information, and the analyses we perform should reflect that and become more ambitious and diverse.
