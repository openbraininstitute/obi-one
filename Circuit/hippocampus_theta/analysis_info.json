    "description": "This analysis run on one simulation set to reproduce theta oscillation in CA1. The notebook plots the activity of PC and one PV+ interneuron. The plot shows how the PV+ neuron entrains the activity of PC, so the two neuron classes have opposite phases. This simulation is far from the activity seen in the complete CA1 model, but it represents a useful simplify model which allows to test simple hypotheses.",
