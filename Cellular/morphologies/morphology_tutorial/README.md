## Summary
Three notebooks with examples to explore and download morphologies with a selected set of metadata. Then, we can analyse their morphological and topological properties.

## Use
Instructions are added in the notebooks. 
Part1: Data_retrieval - search and download morphologies in Open Brain Platform
Part2: Morphometrics - perform morphological analysis and comparison
Part3: Topology - perform topological analysis and comparison
