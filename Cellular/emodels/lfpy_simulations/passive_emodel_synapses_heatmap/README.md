## Summary
Notebook to apply synapses and using LFPy,  recording local field potentials and plotting heatmap

## Use
Download the e-model folder from [here](https://openbraininstitute.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/OBI-Scientificstaff/Ei3QIGh3JFFHkRkY7LRyTpEBm8eUll7HGyusulkPavf5SA?e=7ihV8H) in OneDrive `OBI -> Scientific staff -> Documents -> Data -> Analysis notebook data -> cadpyr_emodel`

For this example, the downloaded folder `cadpyr_emodel` is kept here `./Cellular/emodels` of this repository

The notebook shows the extracellular response of a synaptic input to a passive cADpyr neuron. To use it for a different model replace the morphology in the CellParameters dictionary.
