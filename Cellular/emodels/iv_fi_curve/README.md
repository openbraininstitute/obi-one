## Summary
This notebook demonstrates how to compute and plot the IV (current-voltage) and FI (frequency-current) curves for single cell model using BlueCelluLab. These analyses provide insights into the neuronâ€™s electrical properties, such as its input resistance, firing threshold, and response to varying levels of stimulation. The notebook also explains how to set different injection and recording locations to study various neuron behaviors, like dendritic integration, backpropagation, and somatic excitability, through IV and FI curve analyses.

## Use
In order to run this notebook, you will have to install the dependencies listed in analysis_info.json in requirements.
