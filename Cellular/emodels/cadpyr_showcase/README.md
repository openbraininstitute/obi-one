## Summary
The notebook showcases various properties of detailed morphology cADpyr (continuosly adapting type pyramidal neuron) e-model of the Open Brain Institute(OBI). 
It plots: 
- optimisation protocol responses
- [currentscape](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/Currentscape) analysis
- frequency-current (F-I) curve
- current-voltage (V-I) curve
- recordings in different sections of the neuron using [BlueCellulab](https://github.com/openbraininstitute/BlueCelluLab)
- dendritic potential decay 
- backpropagating action potential (bAP) recordings
- excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) recordings and EPSP ratio.

## Use
Steps to run the notebook are given below:

1. The cADpyr e-model model `hoc` file,  `.asc` morphology file, mechanism (`.mod`) and `EM_*.json` file (containing the e-model parameters) should be obtained from OBI. These could be downloaded from 
  - the [OBI Platform](https://openbraininstitute.org) from `Explore` -->`E-model` section --> Click on an e-model from the list --> `Download`. This final parameters file `EM_*.json` of the e-model.
  - [Blue Brain Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/bluebrain_opendata/) using [Amazon CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) 
  - (temporary for testing purpose) the data for below notebooks is also saved [here](https://openbraininstitute.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/OBI-Scientificstaff/EpqQOMfkUoRIv5mkPmaTdWEBuVeg6qEi93fJbmy-FSsgRA?e=SwGY4V) in a private folder. Put the files in a folder `cadpyr_emodel`. You can choose any other folder name.
2. If you choose a different folder name, you need to update the  
`emodel_folder_path` with relative path your folder name 
e.g.  `emodel_folder_path=Path("../your_folder_name")`

The `emodel_name` (str, optional) can also be changed. Currently, it is set to `cadpyr_emodel`. The detailed instructions are also available in the notebook.

3. Now, you should be able to run the notebook. Follow the notebook text and comments in notebook to learn more about the e-model and results.

You can also test this notebook other pyramidal neuron e-models of OBI. Follow the Step 1 above to replace the models files from OBI platform and update the `emodel_folder_path`.
